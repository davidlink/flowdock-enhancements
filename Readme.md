These are some enhancements I use for Flowdock. They make it look more like
a popular chat client, which really helps in readability.

It will do the following:

* Always display the message time
* Show a user's avatar next to her message

For a screenshot, go to the page linked below.

You can have it as a Fluid.app user script, or as a bookmarklet. For the
bookmarklet, see:
