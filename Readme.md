About
===

These are some enhancements I use for Flowdock. They make it look more like
a popular chat client, which really helps in readability.

It will do the following:

* Always display the message time
* Show a user's avatar next to her message

Usage
===

There's a bookmarklet you can drag into your bookmarks bar and just click after you load a flow.

The bookmarklet is embedded here: http://jensarps.github.com/flowdock-enhancements/

If you're using Fluid, there's also a user script, it's the `Flowdock Enhancements.user.js` file.

This is how it looks like:
